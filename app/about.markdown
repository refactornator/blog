title: About - William Lindner, 2 n's.

I'm a software developer living in San Francisco. I like fast cars, cheap women, and improvisational comedy.

I taught myself to code in Python, Perl and PHP. Learned Computer Science through Java and C++ at Virginia Tech. I've been making websites since before it was cool.
