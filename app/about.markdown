title: About - William Lindner, 2 n's.

I'm a software developer living in San Francisco. I like fast cars, cheap women, and improvisational comedy.

I taught myself to code with Python, Perl, and PHP. I studied Computer Science through Java and C++ at Virginia Tech. And I've been making websites since before it was cool.

I run frontend engineering for [Zoomdata](http://zoomdata.com). We're all about big data visualization. Before we had a team, I spent most of my time laying the foundation for our web based app in [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org). Our team has grown, so now I spend my time keeping anyone who knows Javascript busy, architecting our webapp, keeping our API's tidy and researching ways to knock down reflows and repaints.
