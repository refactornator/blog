title: About - William Lindner, 2 n's.

I'm a software engineer living in San Francisco. I enjoy exploring the bay area, reading philosophy and listening to podcasts. I also enjoy improvisational theater and kickboxing.

I taught myself to code with Python, Perl, and PHP. I studied Computer Science using Java and C++ at Virginia Tech. And I've been making websites since before it was cool. I co-founded [Zoomdata](http://zoomdata.com) (a Big Data visualization company) where I wrote mostly Javascript and managed a team of frontend engineers building the Web UI and doing R&D.

Now I work at [Pivotal](http://pivotal.io/). Practicing Test Driven Development, Pair Programming, and ping-pong.
